# Expansion Modules (μLids)

Besides the mPCIe expansion available on the board and the QWIIC connector, most of the expansion functionality of the board will be available on the board's high density connectors.

## Avaiable Signals

This diagram is a placeholder. Most of these pins have multiple functions that will be documented soon.

## KiCAD template

A [KiCAD template for creating μLid expansion modules](https://github.com/groupgets/kimchi-micro-lid) is available on GitHub, along with some instructions on how to use it.

## Existing μLids
